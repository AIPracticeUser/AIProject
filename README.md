### Project Objective
As lifestyle improve, people are getting more health conscious  especially in their food consumption. With the wide range of local food that is always available, consumers are spoiled for choice, however, they do not have any ways to get 1st hand information on food nutritional value (ex. calories, fats, etc..)

This result in general ignorance of what they are consuming and their daily recommended calorie intake

We have developed an AI solution to give consumer first hand food nutritional
information so that they can make an informed decision on what they are consuming.


With our SnapFood app, consumers will be able to obtain this information at the tip of their fingers, anytime and anywhere 

### Problem Statement

As we know for a fact that obesity is a major contributor to diseases such as diabetes, congestive heart failures, restrictive mobility. In recent local studies of Singapore and obesity, it shows
1. Singaporean’s average weight is increasing as compared to a decade ago
2. Obesity in Singapore is projected to hit 15% by 2024 if nothing is done (Currently, it is 11%)
3. An adult Singaporean average calories per day is increasing

### Problem Statement (contiuned)
Currently the available weight managements mobile apps in the market needs to input the food manually in order for the inbuilt calories calculator to work. These leads to several problems such as
1. Not entering the right food
2. Pick the lowest calorie option every time to “cheat”
3. Wait too long to log and ends up forgotten about it

### Proposed Solution

We decide to use Convolution Neural Network (CNN) as our solution to the problem 

Automatic recognition of dishes would not only help users effortlessly organize their extensive photo collections but would also help online photo repositories make their content more accessible

Additionally, mobile food photography can be used to help patients estimate and track their daily calorie intake on Singapore local foods efficiently.
